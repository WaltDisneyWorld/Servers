# Get Started
This guide will show you how to get started with DList, and add a server, then bump it.

## Step 1
**Add the bot to your server**

![Add Bot](/assets/docs/img/get-started/add-bot.png)

Add the bot to create a default server listing which can be edited via the [dashboard](/dashboard).

## Step 2
**Edit the server listing**

![Edit Server Listing](/assets/docs/img/get-started/edit-listing.png)

Edit the server listing to show potential members what your server is about. 

## Step 3
**Update the invite, to allow users to join, with `.dl invite`**

![Invite Command](/assets/docs/img/get-started/update-invite.png)

This will allow users to join your server. Bot needs `Manage Channels` permission to create an invite.

## Step 4
**Bump server with `.dl bump`**

![Bump Command](/assets/docs/img/get-started/bump-server.png)

When your server listing is ready for users to see, type `.dl bump` to promote it on the front page!
This command can only be done every **30 minutes** for you, and your server.
